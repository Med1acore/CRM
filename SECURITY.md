# Security Policy

## 🔒 Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **Email**: Contact the maintainers directly (check package.json for contact info)
2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the "Security" tab in the repository
3. **Private disclosure**: Request a private issue if available

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description** of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Potential impact** and severity assessment
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
- **Your contact information** for follow-up

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Development**: Depends on severity
- **Disclosure**: After patch is released

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env` or `.env.local` files
   - Use `.env.example` with placeholder values only
   - Rotate API keys regularly

2. **Supabase Security**
   - Enable Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
   - Use `auth.uid()` in RLS policies
   - Never expose `service_role` key in client code
   - Use `anon` key only for client-side operations

3. **Authentication**
   - Enforce strong password requirements
   - Implement rate limiting for login attempts
   - Use secure session management
   - Validate all user inputs

4. **API Security**
   - Validate and sanitize all inputs
   - Use parameterized queries (Supabase handles this)
   - Implement proper CORS policies
   - Rate limit API endpoints

5. **Frontend Security**
   - Sanitize user-generated content before rendering
   - Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` when possible
   - Use Content Security Policy (CSP)
   - Keep dependencies up to date

### For Deployers

1. **Production Environment**
   - Use HTTPS only (no HTTP)
   - Enable HSTS headers
   - Configure secure cookie settings
   - Implement proper CORS policies

2. **Database**
   - Use strong database passwords
   - Enable connection encryption
   - Regular backups with encryption
   - Monitor for suspicious activity

3. **Secrets Management**
   - Use environment variables for secrets
   - Never hardcode credentials
   - Use secret management tools (GitHub Secrets, etc.)
   - Rotate credentials regularly

4. **Monitoring**
   - Enable logging for security events
   - Monitor for suspicious patterns
   - Set up alerts for anomalies
   - Regular security audits

## 🔍 Security Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] All RLS policies are enabled and tested
- [ ] Environment variables are properly configured
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced
- [ ] API keys are not exposed in client code
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date (no known vulnerabilities)
- [ ] Input validation is implemented
- [ ] Rate limiting is configured
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Logging is properly configured
- [ ] Backups are automated and tested

## 🚫 Known Security Considerations

### Database
- All database operations require authentication
- RLS policies enforce user-level access control
- Supabase handles SQL injection prevention

### Authentication
- Passwords are hashed (handled by Supabase Auth)
- Sessions expire after inactivity
- Email verification can be enabled

### File Uploads
- Currently no file upload functionality
- If added: implement size limits, type validation, virus scanning
